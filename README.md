ðŸŒ± Automatic Seed Planter Robot

The Automatic Seed Planter Robot is a compact, battery-powered farming assistant designed to automate and streamline the seed planting process. Powered by an ESP32 microcontroller, it offers precise seed spacing control, a rotary seed sorting system, and a rack-and-pinion punching mechanism for consistent planting depth.

Key Features

Configurable planting gap via Bluetooth app

Optical encoders for accurate distance measurement

Rotary mechanism to dispense one seed at a time

Rack-and-pinion ground punch driven by a solenoid

Dual-motor drive system with gearbox speed reduction

Powered by a 5S Li-ion battery pack with onboard charging and BMS protection

This project is built to make small-scale planting more efficient, precise, and less labor-intensive, helping bridge the gap between manual farming and affordable automation.
